# Edutu Backend Requirements Analysis

This document analyzes the Edutu application to identify exactly what backend services are needed to transform it from a frontend-only prototype to a fully functional application with server-side capabilities.

## Understanding the Current State

Edutu is currently a frontend-only application that simulates backend functionality through:
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Static JSON files for content
- Client-side hooks that mimic backend services
- Intentionally broken services (like the chat) awaiting backend implementation

## Backend Services Required

### 1. User Authentication & Management
**Current State**: Auth screens simulate accounts but don't connect to any backend
**Backend Required**: Complete authentication system

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- User registration and login (email/password, Google OAuth)
- Session management
- User profile management
- Password reset functionality
- Account verification (email confirmation)

### 2. Data Persistence Service
**Current State**: All data stored in localStorage (`edutu_goals_v1`, `edutu.analytics.v1`, `edutu.cv.records`)
**Backend Required**: Server-side database for user data

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- Goals database: Store, retrieve, update, delete user goals
- Analytics database: Track user activities, opportunities explored, chat sessions
- User profiles: Store profile information, preferences, settings
- Data synchronization between devices

### 3. AI Chat Service
**Current State**: `ChatInterface.tsx` intentionally throws error until backend proxy is implemented
**Backend Required**: Secure proxy for AI API calls

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- OpenRouter API proxy to securely handle API keys
- Chat history storage per user
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Usage tracking and billing integration
- Content moderation

### 4. File Storage Service
**Current State**: CV service mimics file uploads but stores everything in localStorage
**Backend Required**: Cloud file storage for document uploads

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- CV document upload and storage
- File type validation and security scanning
- File retrieval for processing
- Document analysis results storage
- PDF generation capability

### 5. Opportunities & Content Management
**Current State**: Static JSON data from `public/data/opportunities.json`
**Backend Required**: Dynamic content management system

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- Opportunities database with search/filter capabilities
- Content management system for admins to add/update opportunities
- Opportunity application tracking
- Integration with external opportunity APIs
- Personalization engine based on user profile

### 6. Community Features
**Current State**: Community marketplace and support flows use static fixtures
**Backend Required**: Real-time community platform

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- Community marketplace with user-generated content
- Peer-to-peer messaging
- Community roadmap sharing
- User reputation/voting system
- Real-time notifications

### 7. Support System
**Current State**: Support responses are static fixtures
**Backend Required**: Ticket management system

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- Support ticket creation and management
- Agent assignment and tracking
- Priority and category management
- Knowledge base integration
- Chat support for real-time assistance

### 8. Analytics & Reporting
**Current State**: Local analytics tracking with no cross-user insights
**Backend Required**: Comprehensive analytics platform

**Specific Backend Needs**:
- User behavior analytics
- Feature usage tracking
- System performance monitoring
- Cohort analysis
- Custom reporting capabilities

## Backend Technology Options

### Database Options
1. **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase/AWS RDS/Neon): Robust, ACID-compliant, excellent for complex queries
2. **MongoDB**: Flexible document storage for varied user data
3. **Firebase Firestore**: Real-time capabilities, familiar to current codebase

### Authentication Options
1. **Supabase Auth**: Integrated with PostgreSQL, social logins, magic links
2. **Firebase Auth**: Pre-built, supports multiple providers
3. **Auth0**: Enterprise-grade identity management
4. **AWS Cognito**: Scalable user directory

### File Storage Options
1. **AWS S3**: Reliable, scalable object storage
2. **Supabase Storage**: Integrated with Supabase ecosystem
3. **Firebase Storage**: Familiar to current codebase

### AI API Hosting
1. **Vercel Edge Functions**: Low-latency AI proxy
2. **Netlify Functions**: Serverless AI integration
3. **AWS Lambda**: Scalable serverless functions
4. **Supabase Functions**: Integrated with Supabase ecosystem

## Backend Architecture Recommendations

### Option 1: Supabase (Recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Built-in Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **API Layer**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Real-time**: Supabase Real-time capabilities
- **Benefits**: Single platform, excellent documentation, generous free tier, direct database access

### Option 2: Firebase
- **Database**: Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **API Layer**: Cloud Functions
- **Benefits**: Familiar to current codebase, real-time capabilities, integrated ecosystem

### Option 3: Custom Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or AWS Cognito
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **API Layer**: Node.js Express on AWS EC2/ECS or Lambda
- **Benefits**: Maximum flexibility and control

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Functionality (MVP)
1. Authentication system
2. Basic data persistence (goals, analytics)
3. AI chat proxy service

### Phase 2: Enhanced Features
1. File storage for CV uploads
2. Improved opportunity database
3. Basic community features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. Comprehensive support system
2. Advanced analytics
3. Real-time community features

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Use server-side functions/proxies for sensitive operations
- Implement environment-based key management

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive user data
- Implement proper access controls
- Regular security audits

### Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs server-side
- Sanitize content to prevent injection attacks
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse

## Deployment & Scaling

### Development Environment
- Local development with mocked backend services
- Staging environment for integration testing

### Production Deployment
- CDN for static assets
- Auto-scaling for API services
- Load balancing for high availability
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

This analysis provides a clear picture of what backend services are essential for Edutu to transition from a frontend prototype to a fully functional application with server-side capabilities.
