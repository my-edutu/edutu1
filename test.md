# System Test Status (2025-10-22)

## Automated Checks
| Command | Result | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `npm run lint` | ❌ Fails | 56 errors, 9 warnings. Dominated by unused symbols and `any` usage (for example `src/App.tsx:35`, `src/components/LandingPage.tsx:7`, `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx:75`) plus hook dependency warnings across dashboards. |
| `npm run build` | ⚠️ Pass with warnings | Build succeeds but Tailwind reports the bundled `@tailwindcss/line-clamp` plugin is redundant and the generated `dist/assets/index-DCmI1av5.js` chunk exceeds 1.5 MB. |
| `npm test` | ⚪ Not available | No test script is defined in `package.json`; automated unit/integration coverage is currently absent. |

## Functional Coverage Snapshot
- **Landing + Auth flow:** Not exercised end-to-end. UI wiring works locally but identity is mocked (`src/components/AuthScreen.tsx`) and no real provider integration exists yet.
- **AI chat assistant:** Blocked. `sendMessageToOpenRouter` deliberately throws (`src/components/ChatInterface.tsx:55`), so any chat attempt will surface an error modal until a secure backend proxy is implemented.
- **Opportunity discovery & goals:** Core data fetch leverages static `public/data/opportunities.json`; flows should render offline, but no runtime verification was performed in this pass. Goal creation relies on local state via `useGoals` and needs manual smoke testing.
- **Community marketplace & CV management:** Screens render-rich UIs but depend on placeholder data/services; behaviour remains unvalidated.
- **Admin console (`/admin`):** Routes exist (`src/admin/AdminRoot.tsx`) yet were not booted or regression-tested; ensure role gating before exposing.
- **Dark mode, notifications, toasts:** Hooks (`useDarkMode`, `useAnalytics`) appear wired, though the absence of automated tests leaves regressions unguarded.

## Notable Issues
- Chat experience currently unusable because of the intentional error throw (see `src/components/ChatInterface.tsx:55`).
- Firebase bootstrap comments in `src/firebase/firebase.ts` contain stray non-ASCII characters that may cause tooling friction.

- Lint blockers need triage: unused imports (e.g. `src/components/Profile.tsx:5`), `prefer-const` violations (`src/components/Dashboard.tsx:568`), empty interface inheritance (`src/components/ui/Input.tsx:4`), and conditional hook usage (`src/pages/admin/community/index.tsx:47`) will all break CI once enforced.

- Build size warning highlights the need for code-splitting or `manualChunks` tuning before production shipment.

## Potential Enhancements
1. Stand up a backend proxy for OpenRouter (or chosen LLM provider) and retrofit the chat UI to handle async failures gracefully.
2. Replace mock authentication with Firebase Auth (already scaffolded in `src/firebase/firebase.ts`) and add protected route guards across user/admin surfaces.
3. Introduce targeted unit tests for hooks (`useGoals`, `useOpportunities`) and component smoke tests via Vitest + React Testing Library; wire `npm test`.
4. Apply lint fixes, enforce TypeScript strictness, and introduce CI to prevent regressions.
5. Split large bundles (lazy-load admin suite, analytics panels, heavy icon sets) to keep initial payload under the 500 kB threshold.
