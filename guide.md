# Edutu Backend Requirements Analysis

This document analyzes the Edutu application to identify exactly what backend services are needed to transform it from a frontend-only prototype to a fully functional application with server-side capabilities.

## Understanding the Current State

Edutu is currently a frontend-only application that simulates backend functionality through:
- LocalStorage for data persistence
- Static JSON files for content
- Client-side hooks that mimic backend services
- Intentionally broken services (like the chat) awaiting backend implementation

## The Backend Required for Edutu

### 1. User Authentication & Management System
**Current State**: Auth screens simulate accounts but don't connect to any backend
**Backend Required**: Complete authentication system

**Specific Backend Components**:
- User registration and login (email/password, Google OAuth)
- Session management with secure tokens
- User profile management API
- Password reset functionality
- Account verification (email confirmation)

**Implementation**: Could use Supabase Auth, Firebase Auth, or Auth0 depending on chosen stack

### 2. Data Persistence & Storage Service
**Current State**: All data stored in localStorage (`edutu_goals_v1`, `edutu.analytics.v1`, `edutu.cv.records`)
**Backend Required**: Server-side database for user data

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **Goals Database**: Store, retrieve, update, delete user goals with user authentication
- **Analytics Database**: Track user activities, opportunities explored, chat sessions
- **User Profile Storage**: Store profile information, preferences, settings
- **Data Synchronization**: Allow users to access their data across devices

**Implementation**: PostgreSQL (Supabase), Firebase Firestore, or MongoDB depending on chosen architecture

### 3. AI Chat Service Proxy
**Current State**: `ChatInterface.tsx` intentionally throws error until backend proxy is implemented
**Backend Required**: Secure proxy for AI API calls

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **API Key Security**: Server-side proxy to securely handle OpenRouter API key
- **Chat History**: Store conversation history per user
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse of the AI service
- **Usage Tracking**: Monitor and potentially bill for usage
- **Content Moderation**: Filter inappropriate user inputs/outputs

**Implementation**: Serverless functions (Vercel, Netlify, or Supabase Edge Functions)

### 4. File Storage & Processing Service
**Current State**: CV service mimics file uploads but stores everything in localStorage
**Backend Required**: Cloud file storage for document uploads with processing capabilities

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **File Upload**: Securely store CV documents in cloud storage (AWS S3, Supabase Storage, etc.)
- **File Validation**: Verify file types and scan for security threats
- **Document Processing**: Perform ATS analysis and optimization on the server
- **Result Storage**: Store analysis results and optimizations in the database
- **PDF Generation**: Server-side PDF generation capabilities

### 5. Opportunities & Content Management System
**Current State**: Static JSON data from `public/data/opportunities.json`
**Backend Required**: Dynamic content management system

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **Opportunities Database**: Store scholarship, job, and fellowship opportunities with search/filter capabilities
- **Admin Panel**: Content management interface for admins to add/update opportunities
- **Application Tracking**: Track user applications to opportunities
- **API Integration**: Connect with external opportunity APIs
- **Personalization Engine**: Algorithm to recommend opportunities based on user profile

### 6. Community Platform
**Current State**: Community marketplace and support flows use static fixtures
**Backend Required**: Full-featured community platform with real-time capabilities

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **Community Marketplace**: User-generated content database for resources and roadmaps
- **Messaging System**: Peer-to-peer messaging between users
- **Roadmap Sharing**: Platform for users to share and discover learning roadmaps
- **Reputation System**: Voting and reputation scoring mechanisms
- **Real-time Notifications**: Push notifications for community activity

### 7. Customer Support System
**Current State**: Support responses are static fixtures
**Backend Required**: Complete ticket management and support system

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **Ticket Management**: Create, assign, and track support tickets
- **Agent Dashboard**: Support agent interface to handle tickets
- **Priority Management**: System for prioritizing tickets
- **Knowledge Base**: FAQ and documentation system
- **Live Chat**: Real-time support chat functionality

### 8. Analytics & Reporting Platform
**Current State**: Local analytics tracking with no cross-user insights
**Backend Required**: Comprehensive analytics and business intelligence platform

**Specific Backend Components**:
- **User Analytics**: Comprehensive tracking of user behavior and engagement
- **Feature Usage**: Track which features are most/least used
- **System Performance**: Monitor API response times and system health
- **Cohort Analysis**: Track user retention and behavior over time
- **Business Intelligence**: Generate reports on platform performance

## Backend Architecture Options

### Option 1: Supabase Backend (Recommended)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Row Level Security
- **Authentication**: Built-in Supabase Auth
- **File Storage**: Supabase Storage
- **API Layer**: Supabase Edge Functions
- **Real-time**: Built-in real-time subscriptions
- **Benefits**: Single integrated platform, generous free tier, excellent documentation

### Option 2: Firebase Backend
- **Database**: Firestore for document storage
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **File Storage**: Firebase Storage
- **API Layer**: Cloud Functions
- **Benefits**: Familiar to current codebase, real-time capabilities

### Option 3: Custom Full-Stack
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (AWS RDS) or MongoDB (Atlas)
- **Authentication**: Auth0 or AWS Cognito
- **File Storage**: AWS S3
- **API Layer**: Node.js/Express on AWS Lambda or EC2
- **Benefits**: Maximum flexibility and control over the technology stack

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Backend Foundation (MVP)
1. **Authentication System**: Implement user registration and login
2. **Data Persistence**: Replace localStorage with server-side storage for goals and analytics
3. **AI Chat Proxy**: Deploy secure proxy for OpenRouter API calls

### Phase 2: Enhanced User Experience
1. **File Storage**: Implement CV upload and storage capabilities
2. **Dynamic Content**: Replace static opportunities with database-driven system
3. **Basic Community**: Implement foundational community features

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
1. **Support System**: Deploy complete customer support platform
2. **Advanced Analytics**: Implement comprehensive analytics and reporting
3. **Real-time Features**: Add real-time community and notification features

## Security Considerations

### API Key Protection
- Never expose API keys in client-side code
- Implement server-side proxies for all third-party API calls
- Use environment-based key management across all deployments

### Data Privacy & Security
- Encrypt sensitive user data both at rest and in transit
- Implement proper access controls with authentication and authorization
- Conduct regular security audits of the backend infrastructure

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Validate all user inputs server-side to prevent injection attacks
- Sanitize file uploads to prevent malicious content
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of services

## Deployment & Scaling Strategy

### Development Environment
- Local development with mocked backend services
- Docker-based local development environment
- Staging environment that mirrors production

### Production Deployment
- CDN for static assets to improve load times
- Auto-scaling for API services based on demand
- Load balancing for high availability
- Comprehensive backup and disaster recovery procedures

This analysis clearly defines the backend requirements for Edutu, transforming it from a frontend-only prototype to a fully functional application with server-side capabilities that can support users at scale.
